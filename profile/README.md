Authless is a highly capable system for authentication and authorization, which offers a user-friendly experience.

The system's modular design enables you to select and deploy only the necessary components for your application, and adjust the system as the requirements increase.

For instance, multiple REST API instances can be operated alongside a single UI instance, which can be distributed with a load balancer.

Additionally, Authless comes equipped with an extensive admin panel, which provides access to its REST API for user and permission management via a visually pleasing UI.

Another benefit of Authless is that it does not rely on external services, and it can be deployed on-premises.

It can also be configured to utilize external databases such as `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`, or `Redis` for caching purposes.
